# Self Evaluation

- Reflect on your time management and awareness of where you spend time.
  Is this a strength or area you are working on? What support do you need in this area? And/or, what tips do you have to share with your classmates in this area?

- ive been a lot better the last couple days about not hurting myself on a problem before asking for input,
  and i think its really been  helping me. i feel like i only have somuch brain power and i hate to wast it on something that could be fixed easily if i just got another perspective.

- How would you explain to a 5 year old what a function is?

- A function is like a little box of Legos that you can carry around and to use later.
  When you want to build your Lego spaceship, you pull out your little box of Legos.
  And if you don't need it right now, you know that it's tucked away safely to be used another time.

- Share your understanding of arguments and parameters.

- I first learned how arguments work from "  argument clinic " by Monty Python.
  In hindsight I'm inclined to agree with Eric, if he really wanted an argument, they would have needed to establish the parameters by which the argument would be held to; which he did try to do I might add, much against the inclination of John Cleese.


-   A parameter can be a placeholder inside of a function or variable to be used with an argument later.
    We can then pass an argument through the parameter to create a specific action, such as adjusting a number or string.



- What questions/topics (related to Functions) do you want to being to your Small Group?

-   It would be nice to cover best practices for integrating arrays and objects into functions would be,
    I feel like I understand it but  it would be nice to talk it through for clarification.
